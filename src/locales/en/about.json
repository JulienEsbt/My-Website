  "bio": "I'm a 26-year-old developer driven by curiosity and coherence between technology and meaning. After graduating with a European Master’s in Computer Science (FinTech specialization), I joined <b>Prepar-Vie</b> to contribute to digital transformation and rethink how software can serve both efficiency and transparency.<br/><br/>My path bridges <b>AI</b>, <b>Web3</b>, <b>cybersecurity</b> and <b>finance</b> — but also philosophy, sociology and aeronautics. I believe real innovation emerges when worlds intersect.<br/><br/>I’m driven by a simple idea: technology should enhance human freedom, not replace it."
